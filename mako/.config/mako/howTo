If you came here for mako + pywal, but didn't use the setup scripts, it works like so:

Instead of using mako default config location, configure mako in ~/.config/wal/templates/mako.conf. Use color codes as explained by pywal. 

Make launch.sh executable, and make sway point to it and "exec_always" the mako launch script. 

run pywal to generate ~/.cache/wal/mako.conf

Finally, symlink the cached wal config to mako default config location:
$ ln -s ~/.cache/wal/mako.conf ~/.config/mako/config

Now, whenever you run pywal, mako will read the new theme. :)
